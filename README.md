The program aims to run test on tital salary data of all employees, close to payroll payment process.
Its sources are Hazuti / 101 tab delimited files and tab delimeted file with working hours data.
The system is modular, so that new test can easily be added in the future, or unneeded or too specific tests may be easily removed.
As result the system produces XLS file with total representation of salary data and results of specific tests. TODO total representation and explanation pf gross current and retro differences in HTML.
The program presents and aimed at hebrew data, but all the work inside is done on engligh versions of these titles, so the program can be easily switched to work with any language.
As long as the salary is complicated and requres tests before or after payment, this program may help.
